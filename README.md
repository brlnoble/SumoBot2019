# SumoBot2019

Sumobots is a competition between autonomous robots, very similar to sumo wrestling. The goal is to push the opponent out of the ring using only sensors and your own algorithms. This was my first time competing, and I was able to make it to the quarter finals. My design utilized reflective sensors and ultrasonic sensors to avoid driving out of the ring and find the opponent.
